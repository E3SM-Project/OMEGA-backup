This directory contains the static library for NetCDF 3.6.3 on 32-bit Windows (lib/netcdfs.lib) and the NetCDF include files (include/netcdf.h, include/netcdf.inc, include/netcdf.mod) for the C, F77 and F90 interfaces.

The library and module file were built with Intel Visual Fortran Composer XE 2011, version 12.0.3470.2008. The format of the module file is to some extent compiler-specific. The Fortran 90 interface, which depends on the module file, may therefore only be usable by Intel Visual Fortran. The library itself - and thus the C and F77 interfaces - should be usable by any Fortran compiler on Windows, provided the calling convention is set correctly. In the library build process, the calling convention was set to the Intel Visual Fortran default, which notable means that all symbol names are in upper case.
